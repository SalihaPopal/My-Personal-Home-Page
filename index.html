  <p>My name is Saliha Popal. I am 46 years old. Originally I am from Afghanistan. My sister and I have been in a hotel in London since we left our country, Afghanistan, in November 2021. Despite living with many Afghan families, we still feel homesick and miss our homeland and relatives.</p>
  <p>After I graduated from school and passed the entrance exam to join medical university, unfortunately, while finishing the first term, the Taliban conquered Afghanistan for the first time. Therefore, all women, including me, had to leave their jobs and studies. I lost hope and enthusiasm for my studies and career.</p>
    <p> My hobbies are designing and making different kinds of dresses, watching informative and documentary videos, specially <em>Mahir Zain songs, and Noaman Ali khan lectures</em>.</p>
   <p> I am keen on learning something new, especially computers or androids. I had no idea about coding before starting it in grasshopper. I couldn't imagine that same when I would be able to make a personal home page on my own. I have enjoyed doing it a lot since I started, so I am delighted to be a part of the coding family. <b>I am appreciated the "Code Your Future" team members' help and support. Thank you very much. </b></p>
